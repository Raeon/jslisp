# About
JSLisp is a hand-built Lisp 'implementation' or interpreter built in JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to allow an easy-to-use yet entirely safe scripting language within JavaScript.

# Usage
For use in a browser, I recommend using browserify to compress the files into a single file. As of right now, the project is also fully NodeJS compatible tested on NodeJS v5.3.0 on Windows 10 x64.

# Contributing
Feel free to open pull requests or fork the project!
